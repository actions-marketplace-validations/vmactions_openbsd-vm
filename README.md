# Run GitHub CI in OpenBSD ![Test](https://github.com/vmactions/openbsd-vm/workflows/Test/badge.svg)

Use this action to run your CI in OpenBSD.

The github workflow only supports Ubuntu, Windows and MacOS. But what if you need an OpenBSD?

This action is to support OpenBSD.


Sample workflow `openbsd.yml`:

```yml

name: Test

on: [push]

jobs:
  testfreebsd:
    runs-on: macos-12
    name: A job to run test OpenBSD
    env:
      MYTOKEN : ${{ secrets.MYTOKEN }}
      MYTOKEN2: "value2"
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Test in OpenBSD
      id: test
      uses: vmactions/openbsd-vm@v0.0.4
      with:
        envs: 'MYTOKEN MYTOKEN2'
        usesh: true
        prepare: pkg_add curl
        run: |
          pwd
          ls -lah
          whoami
          env




```


The `runs-on: macos-12` must be `macos-12`.

The `envs: 'MYTOKEN MYTOKEN2'` is the env names that you want to pass into freebsd vm.

The `run: xxxxx`  is the command you want to run in freebsd vm.

The env variables are all copied into the VM, and the source code and directory are all synchronized into the VM.

The working dir for `run` in the VM is the same as in the Host machine.

All the source code tree in the Host machine are mounted into the VM.

All the `GITHUB_*` as well as `CI=true` env variables are passed into the VM.

So, you will have the same directory and same default env variables when you `run` the CI script.

The default shell in OpenBSD is `ksh`, if you want to use `sh` to execute the `run` script, please set `usesh` to `true`.

The code is shared from the host to the OpenBSD VM via `rsync`, you can choose to use to `sshfs` share code instead.


```

...

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Test in OpenBSD
      id: test
      uses: vmactions/openbsd-vm@v0.0.4
      with:
        envs: 'MYTOKEN MYTOKEN2'
        usesh: true
        sync: sshfs
        prepare: pkg_add curl



...


```

You can add NAT port between the host and the VM.

```
...
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Test in OpenBSD
      id: test
      uses: vmactions/openbsd-vm@v0.0.4
      with:
        envs: 'MYTOKEN MYTOKEN2'
        usesh: true
        nat: |
          "8080": "80"
          "8443": "443"
          udp:"8081": "80"
...
```


The default memory of the VM is 1024MB, you can use `mem` option to set the memory size:

```
...
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Test in OpenBSD
      id: test
      uses: vmactions/openbsd-vm@v0.0.4
      with:
        envs: 'MYTOKEN MYTOKEN2'
        usesh: true
        mem: 2048
...
```



It uses the latest OpenBSD release by default, you can use `release` option to use another version of OpenBSD:

```
...
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Test in OpenBSD
      id: test
      uses: vmactions/openbsd-vm@v0.0.4
      with:
        release: 6.9
...
```

All the supported releases are here: [conf](tree/main/conf)


# Under the hood

GitHub only supports Ubuntu, Windows and MacOS out of the box.

However, the MacOS support virtualization. It has VirtualBox installed.

So, we run the OpenBSD VM in VirtualBox on MacOS.
